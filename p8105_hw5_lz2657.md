Problem 1
---------

First, set up a dataframe containing all file names.

``` r
  df = list.files(path = "./data/") %>%
    as.tibble()

  df
```

    ## # A tibble: 20 x 1
    ##    value     
    ##    <chr>     
    ##  1 con_01.csv
    ##  2 con_02.csv
    ##  3 con_03.csv
    ##  4 con_04.csv
    ##  5 con_05.csv
    ##  6 con_06.csv
    ##  7 con_07.csv
    ##  8 con_08.csv
    ##  9 con_09.csv
    ## 10 con_10.csv
    ## 11 exp_01.csv
    ## 12 exp_02.csv
    ## 13 exp_03.csv
    ## 14 exp_04.csv
    ## 15 exp_05.csv
    ## 16 exp_06.csv
    ## 17 exp_07.csv
    ## 18 exp_08.csv
    ## 19 exp_09.csv
    ## 20 exp_10.csv

Next, make a reading function, read in data for each subject and save the result as the "observe" variable.

``` r
read_csv_function = function(file_name){
  subject =
    read_csv(file = str_c("./data/", file_name)) %>%
    mutate(file = file_name)
}

df = mutate(df, observe = map(.x = df[[1,]], ~ read_csv_function(.x)))
```

    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

Now tidy the result.

``` r
df = df%>%
  separate(value, into = c("arm", "number"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(number = substr(number, 1, 2)) %>%
  unnest %>%
  gather(key = week, value = data, week_1:week_8) %>%
  mutate(week = substr(week, 6, 6)) %>%
  select(arm, number, week, data)

df
```

    ## # A tibble: 160 x 4
    ##    arm   number week   data
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <dbl>
    ##  1 con   01     1      0.2 
    ##  2 con   02     1      1.13
    ##  3 con   03     1      1.77
    ##  4 con   04     1      1.04
    ##  5 con   05     1      0.47
    ##  6 con   06     1      2.37
    ##  7 con   07     1      0.03
    ##  8 con   08     1     -0.08
    ##  9 con   09     1      0.08
    ## 10 con   10     1      2.14
    ## # ... with 150 more rows

Then we can make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time.

``` r
ggplot(df, aes(x = week, y = data, color = number, group = number)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_grid( ~ arm) + 
    labs(
      title = "subject observations over time",
      x = "week",
      y = "observation"
    ) +
    viridis::scale_color_viridis(
      name = "ID", 
      discrete = TRUE
    )
```

![](p8105_hw5_lz2657_files/figure-markdown_github/problem1_plot-1.png)

The observations of the subjects in the control arm almost keep constant and even a little bit decreasing, while those of the experimental arm have an obvious trend of increasing.

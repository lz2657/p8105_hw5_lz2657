Problem 1
---------

First, set up a dataframe containing all file names.

``` r
  df = list.files(path = "./data/") %>%
    as.tibble()

  df
```

    ## # A tibble: 20 x 1
    ##    value     
    ##    <chr>     
    ##  1 con_01.csv
    ##  2 con_02.csv
    ##  3 con_03.csv
    ##  4 con_04.csv
    ##  5 con_05.csv
    ##  6 con_06.csv
    ##  7 con_07.csv
    ##  8 con_08.csv
    ##  9 con_09.csv
    ## 10 con_10.csv
    ## 11 exp_01.csv
    ## 12 exp_02.csv
    ## 13 exp_03.csv
    ## 14 exp_04.csv
    ## 15 exp_05.csv
    ## 16 exp_06.csv
    ## 17 exp_07.csv
    ## 18 exp_08.csv
    ## 19 exp_09.csv
    ## 20 exp_10.csv

Next, make a reading function, read in data for each subject and save the result as the "observe" variable.

``` r
read_csv_function = function(file_name){
  subject =
    read_csv(file = str_c("./data/", file_name)) %>%
    mutate(file = file_name)
}

df = mutate(df, observe = map(.x = df[[1,]], ~ read_csv_function(.x)))
```

    ##   week_6 = col_double(),
    ##   week_7 = col_double(),
    ##   week_8 = col_double()
    ## )

Now tidy the result.

``` r
df = df%>%
  separate(value, into = c("arm", "number"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(number = substr(number, 1, 2)) %>%
  unnest %>%
  gather(key = week, value = data, week_1:week_8) %>%
  mutate(week = substr(week, 6, 6)) %>%
  select(arm, number, week, data)

df
```

    ## # A tibble: 160 x 4
    ##    arm   number week   data
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <dbl>
    ##  1 con   01     1      0.2 
    ##  2 con   02     1      1.13
    ##  3 con   03     1      1.77
    ##  4 con   04     1      1.04
    ##  5 con   05     1      0.47
    ##  6 con   06     1      2.37
    ##  7 con   07     1      0.03
    ##  8 con   08     1     -0.08
    ##  9 con   09     1      0.08
    ## 10 con   10     1      2.14
    ## # ... with 150 more rows

Then we can make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time.

``` r
ggplot(df, aes(x = week, y = data, color = number, group = number)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_grid( ~ arm) + 
    labs(
      title = "subject observations over time",
      x = "week",
      y = "observation"
    ) +
    viridis::scale_color_viridis(
      name = "ID", 
      discrete = TRUE
    )
```

![](p8105_hw5_lz2657_files/figure-markdown_github/problem1_plot-1.png)

The observations of the subjects in the control arm almost keep constant and even a little bit decreasing, while those of the experimental arm have an obvious trend of increasing.

Problem 2
---------

``` r
homicide_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicide_data = 
  read.csv(url(homicide_url), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  as_tibble()

homicide_data
```

    ## # ... with 52,169 more rows, and 6 more variables: victim_sex <chr>,
    ## #   city <chr>, state <chr>, lat <dbl>, lon <chr>, disposition <chr>

The raw dataset has 52179 rows of 12 variables, including uid, reported date, last and first name, race, sex and age of the victims, city, state, latitude, longitude and disposition. All of the dates are from 2007 to 2017. There are four wrong data in the raw dataset. I change these data to what they should be.

Now create a city\_state variable and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides.

``` r
homicide_data = homicide_data %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state)) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarize(total = n(), 
            unsolved = sum(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest"))

homicide_data
```

    ## # A tibble: 50 x 3
    ##    city_state      total unsolved
    ##    <chr>           <int>    <int>
    ##  1 Albuquerque, NM   378      146
    ##  2 Atlanta, GA       973      373
    ##  3 Baltimore, MD    2827     1825
    ##  4 Baton Rouge, LA   424      196
    ##  5 Birmingham, AL    800      347
    ##  6 Boston, MA        614      310
    ##  7 Buffalo, NY       521      319
    ##  8 Charlotte, NC     687      206
    ##  9 Chicago, IL      5535     4073
    ## 10 Cincinnati, OH    694      309
    ## # ... with 40 more rows

For the city of Baltimore, MD, we can estimate the proportion and the CI of homicides that are unsolved.

``` r
homicide_bal_md = filter(homicide_data, city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

homicide_bal_md_prop = tidy(prop.test(homicide_bal_md$unsolved, homicide_bal_md$total)) %>%
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

homicide_bal_md_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    0.646    0.628     0.663

The estimate the proportion and the upper and lower bound of the 95% CI are shown above.
